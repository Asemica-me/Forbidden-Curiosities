                        <p>By choosing from these narratives, visitors can tailor their experience to their interests, with the interface dynamically adjusting to support their chosen perspective. This tailored approach not only enriches the visitor's engagement with the content but also enhances the overall effectiveness of the storytelling within the app.</p>

                        <h3>4.1 Information Architecture</h3>
                    <p>To create a dynamic visualisation of informations about each object avoiding the use of multiple html pages and given that a server use was not allowed, it was decided to store in a json file all the info needed. Using an async function when the html document is loaded the file json is read and the objects informations are stored in variables. A default show is set (the items of the first period, XV-XVII century), unless the redirect variable is set to true, as previously explained. The data of each object are dinamically organized in a table. Here the json file: <a href="assets/data/items.json">items.json</a></p>
                    <p><b>Explanation of the data structure:</b>
                        the "@sort" attribute was set according to the historical data. Its a value that goes from 1 to 20 and it's used to order the object when displayed in any narrative;
                        the "shortName" is used to populate the title row of the table element;
                        the "image" is used to retrive the corresponding image in the assets to be shown beside the table;
                        "shortInfo", "longerInfo" and "fullInfo" are used to populate the description element. On "fullInfo" we will come back soon;
                        the information inside "info" is used to populate the table element. "Title" was used to populate the Header of the table; "Exhibition" "Themes" "Historical Period" "Typology" are used to populate buttons that are used to create an objects set of that specific narrative.</p>

It was thought it would be more practical to write the complete description of the object in a separate html object in order to better organize the content and to not bear excessively weight on the json file. Here an mpck example of a fullInfo html file to understand the structure: <a href="assets/docs/1galileo.html">example</a></p>

                        <h3>4.2 User Experience (UX) and Navigation Structure</h3>
                    <p>The website was developed to let the user to see the exhibition from different points of view, that's why the narratives, the timeline and the exhibition map have their own pages.</p>
                        <p>In the homepage there is an introduction to the exhibition and all the necessary info to go to see the exhibition. From the home is possible to access to the other parts of the website using the navigation bar or the buttons placed near the exhibition introduction.</p>
                        <p>In the Narratives page, the user can fully understand the meanings carried by the objects. Each narrative is briefly, but sufficiently explained and the user is allowed to access the exploration of the exhibition starting from whatever narrative he/she wants by simply clicking a button.</p>
                        <p>In the Timeline there is the historical distribution of the objects along a line. The intent here is to temporally locating the objects to give the user a diachronic idea of the exhibition. Each object is placed by its historical data and the user can read the name of the object and, by clicking a button, to access its description. A side index helps the user to scroll directly to a specif period.</p>
                        <p>The exhibition map has the purpose to guide the user during the exhibition. The user selecting a specific narrative will see where each object related to that narrative is placed in the exhibition space. Also, there is the possibility to access the description of each object.</p>
                        <p>The Items page contains the descriptions of all the objects. To this page all the others pages point when it comes to access the description of an object.<br>Each object is displayed with a table of information on the left, a picture of it and a description that can be more or less detailed and rich accordingly to the will of the user. Indeed, thanks to two buttons the user can expand or reduce the description.<br>In this page there are two ways to choose the objects to see:<ol style="line-height: 2em;"><li>Jumping from a single narrative to another thanks to the buttons in the table of informations.</li><li>Filtering, selecting multiple kinds of narratives to see a more specific set of objects using the filters right below the navigation bar.</li></ol></p>
                        <p>In the longest pages there is a button that will help the user to quickly go back to the top of the page. This is useful to quickly go to the navigation bar, too; given that it was decided to leave the navigation bar at the top of each page in order to leave more space for the viewport content of each page.</p>
                        <p>Animations are distributed all over the website to guide the user in the navigation of the website (e.g. the arrow pointing down in the homepage), to stimulate its attention (e.g. the entrance of the objects in the timeline), and to focus on specific parts of the pages (e.g. the use of a opaque background in the narratives page to focus on the reading of each a narrative).

                    <h3>4.3 Technical Implementation</h3>
                <p>The technical implementation of this project revolves around dynamically handling and displaying data loaded from a JSON file. Its technical implementation is centered on creating an interactive experience where data is fetched, filtered, sorted, and displayed in response to certain predefined rules or user actions.</p>

                <p>At its core, the project begins by leveraging the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to ensure all DOM elements are fully loaded before executing JavaScript. Once the event triggers, an asynchronous function is executed to fetch the .json file, which contains both the data and metadata needed for the application. This file is parsed into JavaScript objects, and key pieces of information, such as the starting narrative, value, and items, are extracted for further use.</p>
                    
                <p>The project utilizes a prepareNarratives function to process the data according to the selected narrative and value. This function filters the items array to match specific conditions based on the metadata. It then sorts the filtered items using a custom comparator that orders them based on a sorting property (`@sort`). If no matching items are found after filtering, the function reverts to using the entire dataset. Once the relevant data is prepared, additional helper functions are called to update the state of the application and render the information for the user.</p>
                    
                <p>The technical design is modular, with specific tasks divided into discrete functions. The use of promises, asynchronous operations, and event listeners highlights the project's focus on asynchronous workflows and responsive design. Callback functions are used to handle events and trigger processes, such as updating the DOM after preparing the narratives.
                The implementation adheres to modern JavaScript standards, including `async`, optional chaining (`?.`), and array methods like `filter` and `sort`. These tools help streamline the handling of dynamic data and ensure the project is maintainable and scalable. </p>

                <h4>Why choosing a dark background color?</h4>
                <ul>
                   <li><b>Enhanced Focus on Content:</b><br>
                    Dark backgrounds help to direct the user's attention to the content, such as album art, track names, and playback controls. By providing a dark backdrop, the vibrant colors of images, buttons, links and other visual elements stand out more prominently. This creates a more immersive experience where the primary focus remains on the content and its associated visuals.</li> 
                    <li><b>Reduced Eye Strain:</b><br>
                    For users who spend long periods using the app, black or dark backgrounds can reduce eye strain compared to bright, white backgrounds. This is particularly beneficial in low-light environments such a museum exhibition, where dark mode can be easier on the eyes and more comfortable for extended reading sessions.</li>
                    <li><b>Battery Efficiency:</b><br>
                    On OLED and AMOLED screens, dark backgrounds can contribute to better battery efficiency. These screens work by lighting up individual pixels, so displaying black or dark colors uses less power compared to bright colors. As a result, dark backgrounds can help extend battery life, which is advantageous for users who rely on their mobile devices throughout the day.</li>
                    <li><b>Elegant and Modern Aesthetic:</b><br>
                    Dark backgrounds are often associated with sophistication and modernity. Considering for instance apps like Spotify, which are deeply integrated into the entertainment and music industry, a sleek, dark design can convey a sense of high-end quality and style. This aesthetic aligns well with the app's branding of Forbidden Curiosities project and the overall user experience.</li>
                    <li><b>Improved Visual Contrast:</b><br>
                    Dark backgrounds enhance the contrast of text and interactive elements, making them more readable and visually striking. For instance, white or brightly colored text and icons pop against a dark background, which can improve accessibility and user interface clarity.</li>
                    <li><b>Minimal Distractions:</b><br>
                    Dark backgrounds create a minimalist environment that reduces visual clutter. This focus on simplicity allows users to concentrate on the content and interactions without being distracted by a busy or colorful interface. It promotes a more seamless and enjoyable listening experience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In summary, a dark color for the background is chosen for its ability to enhance content visibility, reduce eye strain, improve battery efficiency, and maintain a modern aesthetic. It aligns with the app's brand identity and provides a user-friendly experience that supports extended use and visual comfort.</p>

                    <h3>6.3 Typography</h3>
                <p>The typographic choices for this website reflect a thoughtful approach to balancing elegance, readability, and modernity across different sections of the interface. For headers, the use of <b>Garamond</b>, a classic serif font, conveys sophistication and a sense of timelessness. This makes it particularly suitable for emphasizing titles and creating a strong visual hierarchy that draws attention to key content.</p>
                <p>For the main body text, <b>Trebuchet MS</b>, a sans-serif font, is selected for its clean and legible design. Its modern yet approachable style ensures that large blocks of text are easy to read on screens, enhancing user experience without sacrificing aesthetic appeal.</p>
                <p>The <b>Roboto Condensed</b> font in the navbar offers a sleek and contemporary look, well-suited for navigation elements. Its condensed form optimizes space, allowing for efficient use of the horizontal layout while maintaining clarity and visual appeal.</p>
                <p>Finally, the choice of <b>Tahoma</b> for buttons prioritizes functionality and readability. Tahoma’s robust and straightforward design ensures that call-to-action elements are both noticeable and easy to interact with, even at smaller sizes, reinforcing usability while complementing the overall typographic scheme. Together, these fonts create a cohesive visual identity that balances elegance, modernity, and user-friendliness.</p>
