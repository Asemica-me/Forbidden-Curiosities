								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">The Emergence of a Viral Image</h3>
								<p>In March 2023, an AI-generated image of Pope Francis wearing a stylish white puffer jacket went viral, captivating the internet with its unexpected portrayal of the pontiff. Initially celebrated for its humor and creativity, the image quickly became the center of attention as it was revealed to be an artificial creation, sparking widespread discussions about the implications of such realistic digital fabrications.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">The Creator Behind the Image</h3>
								<p>The image was created by Pablo Xavier, a 31-year-old construction worker from Chicago, who used AI art tool Midjourney to generate the now-famous picture. Inspired by his love for creating humorous and psychedelic art, and driven by a personal journey of coping with grief, Pablo designed the image with no malicious intent, viewing it simply as a lighthearted joke.</p>
