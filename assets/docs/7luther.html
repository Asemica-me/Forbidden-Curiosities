		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>Martin Luther's 95 Theses, posted on October 31, 1517, in Wittenberg, Germany, are a seminal document that ignited the Protestant Reformation. Written in Latin and intended for academic debate, these theses were Luther's response to the widespread sale of indulgences by the Catholic Church. The Theses challenged the authority of the Church and questioned its practices regarding salvation and repentance.</p>
		<h4>Critique of Indulgences and Salvation</h4>
		<p>Central to the 95 Theses is Luther's critique of indulgences, which were certificates sold by the Church promising the remission of sins and reducing time in purgatory. Luther argued that true repentance and faith were essential for salvation, rejecting the idea that indulgences could absolve sin without genuine spiritual change. This assertion struck at the core of the Church's financial and spiritual authority.</p>

		<h4>Dissemination and Impact</h4>
