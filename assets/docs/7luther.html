								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Introduction</h3>
								<p>Martin Luther's 95 Theses, posted on October 31, 1517, in Wittenberg, Germany, are a seminal document that ignited the Protestant Reformation. Written in Latin and intended for academic debate, these theses were Luther's response to the widespread sale of indulgences by the Catholic Church. The Theses challenged the authority of the Church and questioned its practices regarding salvation and repentance.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Critique of Indulgences and Salvation</h3>
								<p>Central to the 95 Theses is Luther's critique of indulgences, which were certificates sold by the Church promising the remission of sins and reducing time in purgatory. Luther argued that true repentance and faith were essential for salvation, rejecting the idea that indulgences could absolve sin without genuine spiritual change. This assertion struck at the core of the Church's financial and spiritual authority.</p>

								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Call for Reformation and Scriptural Authority</h3>
									<p>Luther emphasized the primacy of scripture over Church tradition and papal authority. He argued that salvation came through faith alone, not through sacraments or deeds prescribed by the Church. This emphasis on scripture as the ultimate authority in matters of faith laid the foundation for Protestant theological principles, challenging the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church and advocating for a more direct relationship between individuals and God.</p>
									<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Dissemination and Impact</h3>
									<p>Initially intended as a scholarly debate within the academic community, the 95 Theses quickly spread across Europe due to the printing press, which facilitated rapid dissemination of ideas. Translated into German and other languages, Luther's ideas resonated with a wide audience disillusioned with the Church's practices and sparked a wave of religious reform movements across Europe.</p>

										<p>The publication of the 95 Theses sparked intense controversy and condemnation from Church officials, leading to Luther's excommunication in 1521. Despite threats and pressure, Luther refused to retract his writings, asserting his commitment to truth and reform. The Theses provoked debates on religious authority, the nature of faith, and the role of the Church in society, fueling religious and social upheaval in Europe.</p>
										<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Legacy and Historical Significance</h3>
										<p>Martin Luther's 95 Theses mark a pivotal moment in Christian history, shaping the course of Western Christianity and laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Beyond religious reform, Luther's challenge to authority and emphasis on individual conscience influenced broader movements for social and political change. The Theses remain a symbol of courage in questioning established norms and advocating for reform based on conscience and biblical truth.</p>
