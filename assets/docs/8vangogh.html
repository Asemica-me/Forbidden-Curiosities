								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Introduction and Artistic Significance</h3>
								<p>Vincent van Gogh’s "Starry Night" stands as an iconic masterpiece of Western Art History, painted in 1889 during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. This painting is renowned for its swirling, expressive brushstrokes and vibrant colors, depicting a tumultuous night sky dominated by a crescent moon and swirling stars. Van Gogh’s distinctive style, characterized by bold strokes and emotional intensity, captures not only the physical landscape but also the artist’s inner turmoil and profound connection to nature.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Context and Inspirations</h3>
								<p>The masterpiece reflects the artist’s fascination with the night sky and the natural world, themes that permeated his oeuvre. Inspired by the view from his asylum room window, the painting blends reality and imagination, transforming a tranquil scene into a dynamic, emotive composition. The artist’s use of bold contrasts and expressive forms evokes a sense of movement and emotion, inviting viewers into a deeply personal and introspective journey.</p>

								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Symbolism and Interpretations</h3>
									<p>Beyond its aesthetic beauty, the painting has been interpreted as a reflection of Van Gogh’s mental and emotional state. The swirling patterns in the sky and the stark contrast between the luminous stars and the darkened village below suggest a dichotomy between the ethereal and the earthly, perhaps mirroring the artist’s own struggles with mental illness and his quest for spiritual meaning. The cypress tree in the foreground, often associated with death and eternity in Van Gogh’s works, adds another layer of symbolism to the painting’s narrative.</p>
