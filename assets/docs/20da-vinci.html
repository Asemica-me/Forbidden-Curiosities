        <h4>The anatomy studies</h4>
        <p>Since the most ancient times mankind tried to understand the human body structure. Anyway, due to religious issues human corps could not be used as we do nowadays to conduct studies, but animal's instead. So, the concept of human anatomy was full of mistakes and also a taboo that for centuries could not be quesitoned. Eventually starting from Mondino de Liucci human anatomy became based on human body inspections. During the Reinassence this path was undertaken by many stating an overcome of the past misbelieves. Italian phisicians studies were pivotal for the renewed human anatomy, now more complex and developed. Leonardo Da Vinci was one of those who conducted scrupolous studies of the human body so to be the first to design a scientific human anatomy iconography.</p>
        <h4>The Vitruvian Man</h4>
        <p>Da Vinci was not the first to draw a so called vitruvian man. It was a challenge of his times to reproduce what Vitruvio wrote in his De Architectura declared as the perfect human proportions. Vitruvio affirmed that the navel is the body centre, there should be equal distance between the feet and the top of the head, and between the fingers' extremity of the arms; at last the head heigth should be one eighth of the body one and the foot length should be one sixth of the body heigth. Vitruvio also wrote that the perfect human beign could be inscribed, standing and with open arms, inside a circle and a square.</p>

        <h4>Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man</h4>
        <p>Leonardo proposed a version where the circle centre matched the human navel, as suggested by Vitruvio, but differently from his predecessors the centre of the circle did not matched the square's one, and the open arms and the human heigth are excatly the measures of the square. The iconic double couple of limbs are used to show the two positions that makes that human perfectly inscribed inside a sqaure and inside a circle.
        <p>It's clear how Da Vinci's studies of human anatomy had a crucial role in the realisation of this work and if you give a close look to the body it's possible to appreciate how realistic are the position and shape of the muscles.</p>
        <p>Besides that, the vitruvian man represents also the new paradigm assusmed during the Renaissence: mankind as measure of everything. Indeed, the circle stands for perfection, the cosmos. The square stands for mundane world.
            So, given that the human in at the centre of those and is perfectly set inside them, it should means he is the conjunction between those two world and the only creature capable to access both of them. </p>
