								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Introduction</h3>
								<p>The Replica of the Atomic Bomb "Little Boy" represents a pivotal moment in human history, encapsulating the culmination of the Manhattan Project during World War II. Developed by the United States, "Little Boy" was the codename for the uranium-based atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 6, 1945. This event marked the first and only wartime use of nuclear weapons and forever changed the course of modern warfare and global geopolitics. The bomb's deployment on Hiroshima and its devastating effects underscored the immense destructive power of nuclear technology and sparked intense moral and ethical debates worldwide.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Design and Construction</h3>
								<p>The replica faithfully recreates the physical dimensions and external appearance of "Little Boy," which was a relatively simple and crude device compared to later atomic weapons. It consisted of a gun-type assembly where two sub-critical masses of uranium-235 were brought together rapidly to achieve a critical mass, triggering a nuclear chain reaction. The bomb's design reflected the urgent and experimental nature of the Manhattan Project's efforts to harness nuclear fission for military purposes during wartime.</p>

								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Symbolism and Ethical Controversies</h3>
									<p>The exhibit of "Little Boy" serves as a potent symbol of the ethical dilemmas surrounding nuclear warfare. Its use on Hiroshima resulted in unprecedented destruction, causing immediate deaths of tens of thousands of people and long-term health effects due to radiation exposure. The decision to deploy atomic weapons by the United States raised profound moral questions about the use of such devastating force against civilian populations and the ethics of total war. The aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki spurred global movements advocating for nuclear disarmament and arms control treaties.</p>
									<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Historical Impact and Global Reactions</h3>
									<p>Following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, "Little Boy" became emblematic of the nuclear arms race during the Cold War era. The demonstration of nuclear capabilities by the United States influenced global power dynamics and heightened tensions between nuclear-armed nations. The arms race that ensued led to the development of more advanced and powerful nuclear weapons, shaping international relations and strategies for decades to come. The existential threat posed by nuclear weapons continues to be a critical global issue, emphasizing the enduring legacy and significance of "Little Boy."</p>
