								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Introduction and Historical Context</h3>
								<p>The Suffragette hunger strike medal, housed at the Museum of London, UK, stands as a poignant symbol of the women’s suffrage movement in the early 20th century. Awarded to suffragettes who endured hunger strikes while imprisoned for their advocacy of women’s right to vote, this medal embodies the spirit of defiance and resilience against societal norms and governmental oppression. The suffragette movement, spanning several decades, sought to challenge the entrenched patriarchal structures that denied women political agency and representation.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Design and Symbolism</h3>
								<p>The front of the medal depicts a design specific to the suffragette movement, incorporating symbols of strength, unity, and determination. The reverse side bears inscriptions such as "For Valour" or "Hunger Strike," underscoring the courage and commitment of the recipients in their struggle against injustice.</p>

									<p>Each hunger strike medal served not only as a recognition of individual courage but also as a commemoration of the collective sacrifices made by suffragettes in their pursuit of voting rights. The act of hunger striking, despite its physical and psychological toll, became a powerful tool of resistance used by suffragettes to protest their unjust imprisonment and demand political recognition as equals in society.</p>
