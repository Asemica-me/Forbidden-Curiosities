		<h4 >Artwork description</h4>
		<p>The painting depicts a frontal view of a female body lying obliquely and partially covered on the chest. The body actually visible goes from the thighs to the breast. In central position there are the open thighs showing without veils pubic hair and vaginal lips. </p>
		<h4 >Creativity process and tecnique</h4>
		<p>All the work of Gustave Courbet is marked by subjects and environments devoid of classical or literary iconography, often with erotic and sensual subjects, such that one can count among the painters of French realism in vogue in the nineteenth century. It was a convention that if the nude had to be represented, this was justified by mythology, tradition or literature, but Courbet explicitly rejected this and chose to portray reality in a direct and vivid way. He was also a great admirer of the Venetian tonalism and the sensuality of the works of painters such as Titian, Correggio and Veronese. This taste returns to full in L'origin du monde with which the technique shown by the painter save the picture from being considered mere pornography.</p>

		<h4 >Exhibition history</h4>
		<p>L'origin du monde had a troubled exhibition history seen the subject. After the original owner was forced to sell the painting for debt, it disappeared from the galleries and ended up in various private collections (including that of the psychoanlist Lacan). Only in 1995, acquired by the Musée d'Orsay and still on display there, was it again available to the public without filters, as it had been previously.</p>
		<h4 >Reception and Controversies</h4>
		<p>The work aroused great debate since its first appearance, firstly because it rejects the convention applied to represent the female nude and then because it focuses on the female genitalia, never before so shown in a non-pornographic work. It raised and still raises debates about the legitimacy of this way of representing the female body. Although the name of the work refers to a sense of creative power and female fertility, these values have never been so cruelly associated with genitals, but with the hips or abundance of forms. This work of art still has an impact on today’s society so much that the artist Deborah De Robertis tried to go beyond the intent of Courbet. In 2014 she posed in front of the painting towards the unaware public, wearing a gold dress, opening her legs and offering to the viewers a sight on her vaginal orifice.</p>
