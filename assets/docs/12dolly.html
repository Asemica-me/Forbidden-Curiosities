		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>Dolly the Sheep, born on July 5, 1996, at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, was the world's first cloned mammal. She gained international fame as a scientific milestone and ignited widespread ethical debates about cloning technology. Dolly was created using somatic cell nuclear transfer, a groundbreaking technique where the nucleus of an adult sheep's cell was transferred into an egg cell that had its nucleus removed. This method allowed Dolly to inherit genetic material identical to the donor sheep, making her a genetic clone.</p>
		<h4>Scientific and Technological Breakthrough</h4>
		<p>Dolly's creation represented a significant leap in biotechnology and reproductive science. The successful cloning of a mammal demonstrated that the genetic material from a specialized adult cell could be reprogrammed to develop into a complete organism. This breakthrough paved the way for advancements in cloning research and potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and conservation biology.</p>
