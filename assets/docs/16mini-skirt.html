								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Historical Context</h3>
								<p>The spread of the miniskirt is part of a historical context marked by a strong push towards the revival of vitality hard crushed by the legacy of the Second World War and the contemporary international tension due to the so-called Cold War. This vital force was expressed above all by the enormous number of young people born in the post-war period, raised with sacrifices and hopes for a bright future, to be far from the difficult dark past. Thus, in the societies of the 1960s a disruptive will for renewal is spreading which invades every sector of the societies of the time: first of all, that of civil rights, politics, economics and not least cultural, whose products will be so powerful that they will have a powerful echo in the decades to come.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Sixties Fashion</h3>
								<p>As the whole western culture, fashion was in a rapid change through experimentation. New clothes, fabrics, colours, designs changed radically the way fashion was thought and had huge impact in everyday wearing. The mini skirt was part of that change. A kind of mini skirt already existed at least since the '20s - think about the burlesque shows or women sport wearing -, but only thanks to André Courrège the garment went for the first time on the runway and thanks to Mary Quant it became an icon of the sixties. This fashion phenomenon was so powerful to change the women trend towards trousers. Anyway it lasted about a decade before the women turned back to trousers willing and in general to a unisex style.</p>

								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Social Impact</h3>
									<p>In the sixties the skirt was percieved as a symbol of the oppressive and reactionary view on women. So, women started to reject skirts and preferring trousers; but the mini skirt design spread by Mary Quant gave to the skirt a new symbolism: women's reappropriation of their own bodies, women's sexuality expressivity freedom, women's vitality. The entity of the spread of the mini skirt caught unprepared societies still binded laws restricting women wearing freedom, but the phenomenon was so unbridled that they were obliged to accept it.</p>
									<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Mary Quant's Vision</h3>
									<p>Actually, Mary Quant's intent was not to shock the fashion panorama or to take part to her contemporary social changes. Anyway, her will to fully express her idea of fashion, to pursue new ways in garment design and to be an enterpeneur did of Quant a symbol of social changes and so her taste in design inevitably expressed those changes and matched the desires of those women who wanted a new kind of life.</p>
