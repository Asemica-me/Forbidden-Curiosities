								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Introduction to Pierre and Marie Curie's Measurements</h3>
								<p>The sheet of measurements taken by Pierre and Marie Curie on 0.1 g of RaCl₂ encapsulates a pivotal moment in the history of science. This artifact, dated from April 22, 1902, originates from their groundbreaking research on radioactivity. Pierre and Marie Curie's collaborative efforts in the early 20th century revolutionized our understanding of atomic structure and laid the foundation for advancements in both physics and chemistry.</p>
								<h3 style="font-size: 20px; color: #c39911;">Scientific Context and Discovery of Radium</h3>
								<p>In 1898, Pierre and Marie Curie discovered radium, a highly radioactive element, through their systematic study of uranium ore. Radium's discovery marked a significant breakthrough in the field of radioactivity, a term coined by Marie Curie herself. Their subsequent research aimed to determine radium's atomic mass, a crucial step in elucidating its chemical and physical properties.</p>
