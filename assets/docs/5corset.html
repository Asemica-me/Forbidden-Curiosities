    <h4>Functionality</h4>
    <p>Designed to be worn over a chemise, the corset was instrumental in shaping the wearer’s silhouette into the fashionable hourglass figure of the period.

This allowed for a less constricting fit around the waist, focusing instead on enhancing the curves and proportions dictated by contemporary fashion trends.</p>
    <h4>Social Significance</h4>
    <p>During the mid-19th century, the ideal silhouette evolved from a slender, more natural form to one that accentuated a curvaceous figure with a pronounced waist and full skirts. The corset played a pivotal role in achieving this desired shape, emphasizing the feminine attributes of the wearer while adhering to societal standards of beauty and modesty. Its elaborate construction and decorative embellishments often reflected the wearer’s social status and taste.</p>
